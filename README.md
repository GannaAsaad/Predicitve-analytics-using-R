📈 Predictive Analytics Using R

Startups Success Prediction Using R Programming Language.

This project demonstrates predictive analytics workflows in R by building models to predict startup success using real datasets and statistical machine learning techniques.

🚀 Project Summary

This repository contains a complete R-based predictive analytics project focused on modeling, evaluating, and interpreting prediction results to determine the likelihood of startup success.
It combines data exploration, model training & validation, and results visualizations to support data-driven business decisions.

R is a powerful open-source language widely used for statistics, analytics, and predictive modeling, offering extensive packages for machine learning, visualization, and reproducible reporting.

Tools & Techniques:

R & RStudio:	Core environment for scripting and analysis

R Markdown:	Integrated reporting with code, results, and visuals

ggplot2 / tidyverse: Data manipulation and visualization

Machine Learning Packages:	Building predictive models (e.g., regression, classification)

Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, ROC, confusion matrices

🚀 Getting Started:

1- Install R & RStudio

- Download and install the latest versions of R and the RStudio IDE.

2- Install Required Packages

- install.packages(c("tidyverse","caret","randomForest","ggplot2","ROCR"))


3- Open the R Markdown File

- Open Final Startup project-2024.Rmd in RStudio.
